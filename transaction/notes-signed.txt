If your register really does contain signed information then semantically you should define it as :  
reg signed [15:0] my_reg;  

reg signed [15:0] my_reg;
reg        [15:0] my_reg_unsigned;

To absolute the value:

always @* begin
  if (my_reg < 16'd0) begin
    my_reg_unsigned = -my_reg ;
  end
  else begin
    my_reg_unsigned = my_reg ;
  end
end

If you do not need to absolute it but just want to use that number to drive some 
thing it is valid to just connect signed to an unsigned, ie:

always @* begin
  my_reg_unsigned = my_reg ;
end
